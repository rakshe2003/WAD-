        <h2>Welcome to Smt. Kashibai Navale College of Engineering</h2>
        

        <p>Placements: My experience with placement is the best; I placed in Jio as a GET with 6 LPA. In our class, 60% of students were placed in Jio
            , Vedanta, HCL, and L&T, with an average package of 3.5 LPA and the lowest of 2.2 LPA. In our class, 20 people were selected for an internship at Cognizant with a stipend. The top role offered is assistant manager.
        
            Infrastructure: From our point of view, our college is the best in Pune because of its facilities: well-equipped labs, free Wi-Fi on campus, big classrooms and a 24*7 library. Hostel rooms are big, food is good, one time non-vegetarian and one time sweet is given. The hostel fee is Rs. 65,000. 3 fields are there for sports beside the college building.

            
            Faculty: Teachers are frequently changing, which is why we need to adjust every time we have new teachers. That needs to stop. Some teachers teaching quality is good; in some cases, it is poor. Course curriculum make students industry-ready because they consist of the latest technologies, like VLSI. Semester exams are medium to difficult; in our batch, 75 out of 99 got all clear.

            
            Other: I chose this course I have an interest in electronics. Some teachers need to be replaced because they need to improve. Events are frequently organized by the college.
